# React-js-html
This repository contains code on basic html, java script and react programming.

The basic html scripts like Adding text, onClick and onChange functions with their corresponding implentation in both react and javascrift.

I also included the tictactoe game using useState without classes, same goes for the todo List code where I included the toggle function.
